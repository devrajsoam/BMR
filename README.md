BMR — Build My Resume
Animated, interactive, ATS‑friendly resume builder with professional A4 export, smooth scroll interactions, dark theme, style presets, and client‑side photo cropping — all running fully in the browser.

Features
Live builder with real‑time preview of Profile, Contact, Skills, Experience, Education, and Projects sections.

One‑click export to PDF (A4), PNG (full page), or standalone HTML snapshot with embedded styles.

Smooth scroll interactions with an animated banner and section reveals for a modern, professional feel.

Dark theme visual design with glassmorphism accents and crisp typography suitable for ATS parsing.

Project helper content structure covering purpose, audience, impact, and stack to avoid empty sections.

Branding: BMR Maker by Devraj Soam with contact number and email embedded in the interface.

Getting started
Clone or download the repository, then open index.html in a modern desktop browser (no backend required).

Use the builder form to enter details and see the preview update instantly.

Click Export Resume to choose PDF (A4), PNG, or HTML, set a filename, and download.

Usage
Profile: Add name, title, summary, and profile photo (via crop modal before insertion).

Contact: Email, phone, location, and website/social links.

Skills: Comma‑separated list displayed as chips in the preview.

Experience/Education/Projects: Add multiple entries; preview updates as details are typed.

Export: Use the Export Resume dialog to select format and file name, then confirm to save.

Project structure
index.html — App shell, hero/banner, builder form, preview canvas, and export dialog UI.

styles.css — Dark theme, layout, glassmorphism, A4 page sizing, responsive and print rules.

script.js — Smooth scrolling and scroll‑triggered animations, bindings, repeaters, photo crop, and export logic.

README.md — This document.

Export formats
PDF (A4): Print‑ready output tuned for resume use.

PNG: High‑resolution full‑page screenshot of the preview.

HTML: Self‑contained snapshot for easy sharing or hosting.

Notes
For long resumes, consider trimming sections or adjusting layout to avoid awkward page breaks in PDF.

Best fidelity for export is typically on desktop Chrome/Edge.

The builder is entirely client‑side; personal data never leaves the browser when used locally.
